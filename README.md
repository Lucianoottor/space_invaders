# Space Invaders

This project is a remake of the classical game Space Invaders. The original game was written in C, but I've used Python for the adaptation and made an executable file which is disponible for download on the project files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. Have fun :)

### Installing

First, download the directory named space_invades_exec.
Then, extract the files. Open the executable file named Space Invaders

Then, the game should open.

### How to play

The game is simple: you can dodge the shots to the left or right, or hiding behind the obstacles. Your objective is destroy all aliens by shooting at them. You have 3 lives, but there is an extra floating in the space, so shoot it to get it.

## Construction of the project

For this remake, I've used Python 3 and 2 libraries:
  Pygame for developing the game;
  cx_Freeze for the executable file.
